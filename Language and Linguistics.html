<h3>	1. Language is arbitrary, vocal system of human communication. Explain	</h3>
<p>		Language is a system of symbols, signs, or sounds that allow human beings to communicate with each other. The symbols and sounds used in language are not naturally connected to the objects or concepts they represent, meaning they are arbitrary. For example, the word "dog" in English is not inherently connected to the concept of a canine animal, it is simply a agreed-upon symbol used to refer to that concept. This arbitrariness of language allows for flexibility in communication, allowing humans to create new symbols and signs as needed to convey new ideas and experiences	</p>

<!--	Question No 1	-->

<h3>	2. What are the basic features of human languages? Describe briefly.	</h3>
<p>		Human languages have several basic features, including:
<br><br>
1. Phonology: The study of the sounds used in a language, including the rules for combining those sounds into words.
<br><br>
2. Morphology: The study of the internal structure of words, including the rules for forming words from smaller units called morphemes.
<br><br>
3. Syntax: The study of the rules for combining words into sentences.
<br><br>
4. Semantics: The study of the meaning of words and sentences.
<br><br>
5. Pragmatics: The study of the context in which language is used, including the ways in which speakers use language to achieve social and communicative goals.
<br><br>
6. Discourse: The study of language use in longer stretches of speech or writing, including the ways in which speakers or writers link sentences together to convey meaning.
<br><br>
These features allow humans to communicate a wide range of thoughts, feelings, and experiences through language, and to convey meaning in complex and nuanced ways	</p>

<h3>	3. clarify the basic difference between animal communication and human language.	</h3>
<p>		Animal communication is a type of behavior that animals use to exchange information, often related to survival and reproduction. It is often instinctual and can involve vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. Human language, on the other hand, is a symbolic and structured system of communication that allows for the expression of an infinite range of ideas and meanings. Human language is unique in its ability to create abstract concepts and convey them through symbols and grammar. While animal communication can be complex, it is limited in comparison to human language in terms of flexibility, creativity, and cognitive representation.	</p>

<!--	Question No 3	-->

<h3>	4. Explain why animal communication cannot be regarded as human languages.	</h3>
<p>		Animal communication is different from human language in several fundamental ways:
<br><br>
1. Semanticity: Animal communication lacks the systematic relationship between sounds and meanings that human language has.
<br><br>
2. Productivity: Animal communication is not productive in the sense that animals can't create new meanings or combinations of sounds to express new thoughts.
<br><br>
3. Displacement: Animal communication does not have the capacity for displacement, meaning the ability to refer to things or events that are not in the present or immediate environment.
<br><br>
4. Cultural transmission: Animal communication is not culturally transmitted and shaped by a community of users over time, as human language is.
<br><br>
5. Syntax: Animal communication lacks the complex grammatical structure that allows humans to generate an infinite number of sentences with a limited set of words.
<br><br>
These differences demonstrate that while animal communication serves important functions in their communities, it cannot be considered the same as human language	</p>

<h3>	5. What are the major difference between theoretical linguistics and applied linguistics?	</h3>
<p>		Theoretical Linguistics is a branch of linguistics that focuses on the study of language itself, including its structure, development, and history, without any specific practical application in mind. It is mainly concerned with understanding how language works in the mind and how it is represented in the brain.
<br><br>
Applied Linguistics, on the other hand, takes the theories and insights from theoretical linguistics and uses them to solve real-world language problems and improve language teaching and learning. This field is concerned with practical applications such as language acquisition, language assessment, language pedagogy, and translation and interpretation.
<br><br>
In summary, Theoretical Linguistics focuses on understanding language in a general sense, while Applied Linguistics focuses on solving practical language problems	</p>

<h3>	10. Write in short about the following:,	</h3>


<h3>	A. Content words and function word's.	</h3>
<p>		Content words: Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs
<br><br>
Function words: Pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, interjections, auxiliary verbs, modals.	</p>

<h3>	B. Lexical meaning and grammatical meaning.	</h3>
<p>		Lexical meaning refers to the meaning of a single word or lexeme, which is independent of its context or the words surrounding it. For example, the lexical meaning of the word "apple" is a type of fruit.
<br><br>
Grammatical meaning refers to the meaning conveyed by the way words are put together in a sentence and their relationships to one another. It involves the use of grammar rules to express concepts such as tense, aspect, mood, and voice. For example, the grammatical meaning of the sentence "I am eating an apple" conveys information about the subject's action in the present tense.	</p>

<h3>	11. What is semantics? Briefly mention it's scope.	</h3>
<p>		Semantics is the study of meaning in language, including the meaning of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of discourse. The scope of semantics encompasses the analysis of how speakers of a language use words to convey meaning and the interpretation of meaning in context. This includes examining the relationships between words, the ways in which the meanings of words change over time, and the influence of context on the interpretation of meaning. Semantics also explores the relationships between language and thought, as well as the ways in which language can be used to convey abstract concepts and ideas.	</p>

<h3>	12. Write short notes on:	</h3>

<h3>	1. Synonymy	</h3>
<p>		Synonymy is a linguistic relationship between two words that have the same or nearly the same meaning. It is the quality of having the same or nearly the same meaning of words or phrases in the same language. Synonyms can help to add precision, vary language, and to avoid repetition in written and spoken language. Some examples of synonyms include happy and joyful, big and large, and start and begin.	</p>

<h3>	2. Antonymy	</h3>
<p>		Antonymy is a linguistic and semantic relation between words that are opposite in meaning, such as hot and cold, or big and small. Antonyms can be used to express contrast or to convey an opposite idea. They play an important role in language and communication, allowing speakers to express a wide range of emotions, thoughts, and ideas.	</p>

<h3>	3. Hyponymy	</h3>
<p>		Hyponymy refers to a relationship between words where one word, the hyponym, is a more specific term for a more general term, the hypernym. For example, "dog" is a hyponym of "animal", and "apple" is a hyponym of "fruit". In this relationship, the hypernym encompasses the meaning of the hyponym, but the hyponym does not encompass the meaning of the hypernym.	</p>

<h3>	4.Homonymy	</h3>
<p>		Homonymy is a linguistic phenomenon where two or more words have the same spelling or pronunciation but different meanings. This can create confusion and misunderstandings in communication. Examples of homonyms include "bass" (a type of fish or a low musical note) and "lead" (to guide or a metal element).	</p>
