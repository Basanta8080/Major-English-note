<h1> The Three Questions  </h1>

<p>
"The Three Questions" is a short story by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. The story revolves around a king who wants to know the answers to three important questions: "When is the best time to do things?", "Who are the most important people?", and "What is the most important thing to do?".
</p>
<p>
To find the answers to these questions, the king sets out on a journey and meets different people along the way, including a wise hermit, who teaches him the true answers to his questions. The hermit tells the king that the best time to do things is "Now", that the most important people are those who are present in your life at this moment, and that the most important thing to do is to love and serve others.
</p>
<p>
The story is a simple and uplifting tale that highlights the importance of living in the present and treating others with kindness and compassion. It serves as a reminder to not let life's busyness and distractions prevent us from appreciating the simple things in life and the people around us.
